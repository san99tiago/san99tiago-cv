### DNS Workflow Diagram [Dev/Prod]

The DNS workflow is designed for a multi-account deployment with DEV/PROD environments:

<img src="assets/dns_multi_account_san99tiago_com.png" width=90%> <br>

### Domain Strategy

- **PROD**: [san99tiago.com](https://san99tiago.com) → Always active
- **DEV**: [dev.san99tiago.com](https://dev.san99tiago.com) → Active for testing/validation

### Multi-Account Benefits

- **Security Isolation**: Complete separation between environments
- **Cost Management**: Independent billing and resource tracking
- **Access Control**: Environment-specific IAM policies and roles
- **Risk Mitigation**: Production isolation from development changes

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Details

### AWS CDK Stack Components

The infrastructure is defined using AWS CDK with TypeScript:

**Core Resources:**

- **S3 Bucket**: Static website hosting with encryption and versioning
- **CloudFront Distribution**: Global CDN with custom domain support
- **Route 53 Records**: DNS management for primary and www domains
- **ACM Certificate**: SSL/TLS certificate with automatic renewal
- **CloudFront Functions**: URL rewriting for Next.js compatibility

**Security Features:**

- **Origin Access Identity**: Secure S3 access via CloudFront only
- **Response Headers Policy**: Security headers enforcement
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Modern encryption standards
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive request logging

### CloudFront Functions

Custom JavaScript function for URL rewriting:

- Handles Next.js static export routing
- Ensures proper `.html` file serving
- Maintains clean URLs for better UX

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Load Testing Results

Based on Locust load testing framework:

- **Concurrent Users**: Tested up to 100+ simultaneous users
- **Response Times**: Average < 200ms for static content
- **Throughput**: 1000+ requests/second capability
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% under normal load conditions

### CloudFront Performance

- **Global Edge Locations**: 400+ edge locations worldwide
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: 95%+ for static assets
- **Origin Shield**: Additional caching layer for improved performance

## 🚨 Important Operational Notes

### Certificate Management

The Route 53 Hosted Zones are pre-configured in both DEV and PROD AWS accounts, enabling automatic ACM certificate validation during CDK deployment. If hosted zones were managed in different AWS accounts, manual DNS validation would be required to verify domain ownership.

### Infrastructure Destruction

**⚠️ Caution: Destruction is manual-only to prevent accidental deletions**

Two options for infrastructure cleanup:

1. **CloudFormation Console**: Delete the stack directly from AWS Console
2. **CDK CLI**: Set environment variable and destroy
   ```bash
   export DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=dev  # or prod
   cd cdk
   cdk destroy
   ```

> **Note**: Destruction is intentionally excluded from CI/CD pipelines to prevent accidental production outages.

### Cost Optimization

- **S3 Intelligent Tiering**: Automatic cost optimization for storage
- **CloudFront Pricing**: Optimized for global distribution
- **Development Environment**: Reduced features for cost efficiency
- **Resource Tagging**: Comprehensive tagging for cost allocation
