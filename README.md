# SAN99TIAGO-CV

Awesome NextJs app for my personal CV Website (production-grade framework on top of React).

## TODO: Update README with relevant test/build/deploy info.

## Important Remark

As I already have configured the Route 53 Hosted Zones on the target deployment accounts, the validation process is automatic during the CDK/CloudFormation deployment. If the Hosted Zones were in another account, the validation of the certificates would need to be done during the deployment manually in the Hosted Zone corresponding to the domain.
